[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1f48977e74514538bae8de37cb04d063)](https://www.codacy.com/app/kerndog73/Texture-Atlas-Generator?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kerndog73/Texture-Atlas-Generator&utm_campaign=badger)

A command-line tool for packing spritesheets and creating bitmap fonts

## What does it do?
This tool can be used to pack images into a spritesheet and produce a YAML based atlas describing the spritesheet. This tool can also be used to create bitmap fonts by opening a TTF file, packing glyphs into an image and describing the glyphs in a YAML document. A full list of up-to-date options can be found in [app.cpp](https://github.com/Kerndog73/Texture-Atlas-Generator/blob/master/Texture%20Atlas%20Generator/app.cpp)

## Download the Xcode project
1. Download the project.
2. If you don't have homebrew then `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

4. Install docopt. (not available with homebrew)
   * Download the [docopt repo](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.cpp). 
   * If you don't have `cmake` then install it with `brew install cmake`
   * Navigate to the repo with `cd`, `mkdir build && cd build && cmake -G Unix\ Makefiles ./../`
   * If that worked fine then `make && sudo make install`. You'll have to type in your admin password.
