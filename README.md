# Texture-Atlas-Generator
A command-line tool for packing spritesheets and creating bitmap fonts

## What does it do?
This tool can be used to pack images into a spritesheet and produce a YAML based atlas describing the spritesheet. This tool can also be used to create bitmap fonts by opening a TTF file, packing glyphs into an image and describing the glyphs in a YAML document. A full list of up-to-date options can be found in [app.cpp](https://github.com/Kerndog73/Texture-Atlas-Generator/blob/master/Texture%20Atlas%20Generator/app.cpp)
